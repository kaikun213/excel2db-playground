# Excel2DB Playground

Any tools and scripts used in the context of transforming excel data to populate a database.

Mainly preprocessing for projects processing [TROY200](https://github.com/kaikun213/fonduer-troy200) and an [ENRON based spreadsheet corps](https://github.com/kaikun213/fonduer-electricity) with the [Fonduer framework](https://github.com/HazyResearch/fonduer) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05028.pdf)). We apply preprocessing similar to the [cell annotation algorithm](https://github.com/majidghgol/TabularCellTypeClassification) ([paper](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.focus.lib.kth.se/document/8970946)) in order to gain insights on the table structures and utilize it in Fonduer.
